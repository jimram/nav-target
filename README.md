# nav:target

## Simple, Semantic, Script free, Accessible Navigation pattern.


### Structure

The navigation sits at the bottom of your document with an id of "#main-naviagtion". 

In the header you place a 'jump to link' with a href of "#main-naviagtion".

When triggered the navigation is positioned at the top of the viewport and slides into position using CSS transitions.

Within the navigation element there's another 'jump to link' - this one has a blank href of "#" which triggers the navigation to close.

Simples.

### Support

#### Browsers
Works perfectly Support from IE9+. 

In browsers that don't support :target or css transitions it degrades to a simple jump menu.
